          I&apos;m Md. Nasim Afroj Taj and I&apos;m thrilled to welcome you to
          my portfolio. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Nanoelectronics and
          2-D Materials as a graduate student in the Department of ECE at the
          prestigious{" "}

          Under the supervision of Dr. Mona Zebarjadi. I joined her Energy
          Science Nanotechnology & Imagination Lab (E-Snail) in the Fall of 23
          semester.

          I was engaged as a lecturer in the TMDM department at the esteemed
          Bangladesh University of Textiles (BUTEX). I earned my Bachelor of
          Science (B.Sc.) degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE)
          with a specialization in Electronics from the renowned

            Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)
          </span>
          . Throughout my undergraduate studies, my research focus revolved
          around the fascinating realm of plasmonic nanolasers, working closely
          with the distinguished Professor Dr. Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder.
          Dr. Talukder, a prominent figure in the Department of EEE at BUET,
          serves as the head of the Nanophotonics Research Group and is also the
          director of the Research and Innovation Center for Science and
          Engineering (RISE) at BUET.

            Apart from my academic pursuits, I have actively contributed to
            various nonprofit organizations, where I had the privilege of
            holding leadership roles, being a dedicated member, and volunteering
            my time. These experiences have equipped me with valuable skills and
            a keen understanding of working efficiently and successfully on a
            wide range of tasks, both independently and as part of a team. As a
            quick learner with an eager and analytical mindset, I excel in
            programming and circuit design. Thriving in high-pressure,
            deadline-driven, and goal-oriented environments is where I truly
            shine.
